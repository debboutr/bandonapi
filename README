# TODOS and considerations
* backing up from gpkg or sqlite?
[ ] return bearing line to green and orthagonals
[ ] create URLs/geometries for all courses


add course in to path param...
=> look for lat, lon in relation to total polygon...
=> if not intersection no course, distances can be null OR 0
=> if you intersect w/ a 50 m buffer of a green, last green will become
    current green
=> if you intersect with a hole poly, course can be updated/maintained

{
  course: "", null or falsy
  last_green: 11, would be null or falsy
  measurements: {
    front: ...,
    middle: ...,
    back: ...,
  }
}
